Tauar is an online platform designed to serve as a dynamic database of product prices and availability in specific stores. 
Our goal is to help citizens of our city—and eventually the entire country—find the most financially and geographically convenient shopping options.
By providing users with up-to-date pricing information and store locations, Tauar enables smarter and more efficient decision-making for everyday purchases. 
We won 2 Republican Science Fair competitions, but the team fell apart. 
Unfortunately, this project is no longer in use at this moment.
